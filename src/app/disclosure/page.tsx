        <p>K Young is free to use. It is paid for by affiliate links: if you buy after following one, the shop may pay us a commission. You pay the same price.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>eBay Partner Network:</strong> links to eBay listings and searches.</li>
          <li><strong>Amazon Associates:</strong> as an Amazon Associate we earn from qualifying purchases.</li>
          <li><strong>Beauty retailers and networks:</strong> retailers such as YesStyle, Stylevana, Olive Young Global and iHerb, through their own programs or networks such as Awin, Impact, FlexOffers and Involve Asia, once they accept us.</li>
          <li><strong>Store programs:</strong> stores marked &quot;Paid link&quot; run an affiliate program we belong to.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Links that can pay us are marked &quot;Paid link&quot; or &quot;Ad&quot; and carry rel=&quot;sponsored&quot;. Commission never decides the order of prices: stores are sorted by price, cheapest first, and the paid retailer rows sit apart in their own labelled block.</p>
        <p>Links to stores that pay us nothing carry a referral tag (utm_source={SITE.domain}) so the store can see we sent you.</p>
