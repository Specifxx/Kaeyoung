  "Copy the address of the store's product page (in a phone browser: Share, then Copy).",

const FAQ = [
  { q: "Which links does it work with?", a: `Product pages at any store ${SITE.name} reads: it compares the price with the other stores in that store's country. For Amazon, eBay, marketplaces and stores we don't read, it offers a search of our prices with the link's words.` },
  { q: "Do you open the page I paste?", a: "No. The checker only reads the store's address and the product's part of the link, then looks it up in the listings we already read from that store every day." },
  { q: "Why is the store's price different from the page?", a: "We read each store once a day, so a price can change in between. Type the price the page shows now and the verdict updates." },
  { q: "What counts as a good price?", a: "The cheapest in-stock store price we found, or within 1% of it. Under the median (the middle in-stock store price) is fair; about the median is typical; above it, you can usually pay less elsewhere. Amazon, eBay and partner retailers are not counted as stores here." },
  { q: "Does it include shipping?", a: "No. Every price is the store's own item price before shipping, the way the rest of the site compares them. The product page shows delivery where we know it." },
